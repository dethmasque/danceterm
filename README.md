## N1DAW Release Notes

### July 17th, 2025

#### v0.0.1

* Publicize silly 1-day project. The repo is named `danceterm` because 
  the initial idea was to create a command line rhythm game. Maybe it 
  will become that some day! But for now, it's whimsical fun that would 
  probably only be of professional use to Noise Musician.
